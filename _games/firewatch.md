Right after playing I rated this a seven. Gameplay is alright, nothing special. But a week after I'm still thinking about the story, the art, the music, etc... I seriously can't get this game out of my head. I think this is one that grows on you if you appreciate a good story. So, I've adjusted my score. Not many games can do this to me.
