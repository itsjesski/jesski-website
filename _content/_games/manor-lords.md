Normally I love these types of games, but the military portion is jank. From what I can tell, it's nearly impossible to get armor and weapons before the first raid. That means most of your town will be burnt. For me, I couldn't figure out how to get these items even after 4-5 raids. It might be a me problem, but it spoiled he experience.
