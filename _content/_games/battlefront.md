Looks fantastic, but is disappointing in many ways. Being a hero is rare in the main game modes, matchmaking is messed up, bugs bugs bugs. I often lost textures on my character's hair and my sound would cut out randomly. Both of these were issues I found large forum posts about but have not been fixed a month after release.
