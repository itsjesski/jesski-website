Hello and welcome to my new site! I started this project so that I could get deeper into React, Typescript, and other modern technology used in web development. I'm not one to just look at tutorials alone to learn something, I have to be super hands on. So, I decided that building a personal site to house my online shinanigans would be a good start. Thus, this website was born!

This site is going to house a bunch of weird random things, most of which has come to fruition due to streaming on twitch. You'll find a list of every game I've played since 2016, these blog posts, my PC specs, game screenshots, and all sorts of things.

I hope you enjoy it here, and please let me know if you have any recommendations!
