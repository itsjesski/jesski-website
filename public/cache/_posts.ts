      "\r\nHello and welcome to my new site! I started this project so that I could get deeper into React, Typescript, and other modern technology used in web development. I'm not one to just look at tutorials alone to learn something, I have to be super hands on. So, I decided that building a personal site to house my online shinanigans would be a good start. Thus, this website was born!\r\n\r\nThis site is going to house a bunch of weird random things, most of which has come to fruition due to streaming on twitch. You'll find a list of every game I've played since 2016, these blog posts, my PC specs, game screenshots, and all sorts of things.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it here, and please let me know if you have any recommendations!\r\n",
